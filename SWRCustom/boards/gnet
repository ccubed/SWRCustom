Our corporation is now able to produce the highest quality blasters, armor,
clothing, ships, and jewelry available.  We offer huge discounts to our
members therefore there is no reason to shop from those not affiliated
with the DSC.  Merchants and craftsmen who refuse to join our corporation
endanger all corporation member's job security by threatening to undercut
our set prices and stealing money from each of us.  Do not conduct
business with these people, transgressors can expect reprimands or fines
depending on the severity.
