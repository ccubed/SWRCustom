&RC&rlass&Rr&room &C: &R Perma-Death&w~
On certain MUDs you can die with no limits to dieing and go on forever, but
on MUDs like Planets : Rise to Power, you only have one life and if you
die it's time to make an alternate character.     This is where Cloning
comes in handy, you pay a credit fee and get a free copy of yourself so
that if you burn up in a space shuttle or something along the lines of
dying you have another character.
